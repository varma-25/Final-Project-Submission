 Project Description â€“ Agricultural Productivity Analysis Using Power BI
This project focuses on analyzing agricultural productivity across Indian states using Power BI. Over three weeks, multiple aspects of crop production data were explored, visualized, and analyzed to identify trends, patterns, and regional variations.

ðŸ”¹ Week 1: Initial Data Exploration & Basic Visualization
Imported and cleaned the dataset containing crop-wise, state-wise, and year-wise agricultural data

Created key visuals:

Bar chart showing Top 5 crops by production

Line chart for year-wise production trend

Rainfall analysis by state

Enabled basic filtering using slicers for Crop, Year, and State

ðŸ”¹ Week 2: Advanced Visualization & Interactivity
Added KPI cards for average rainfall, fertilizer use, pesticide use, and total production

Built:

Bar chart for average crop production

Pie chart for state-wise production share

Combo chart to observe fertilizer vs. production trends

Improved dashboard layout and added interactive slicers

ðŸ”¹ Week 3: Yield & Trend Analysis
Created a Filled Map to visualize average crop yield by state

Developed a line chart to compare year-wise production trends across crops

Enabled filtering by crop, year, and state using slicers

 Summary:
The project demonstrates the ability to convert raw agricultural data into meaningful insights using Power BI. It highlights production patterns, crop-wise trends, and regional yield variations with interactive, user-friendly dashboards.
